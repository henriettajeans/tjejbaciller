<h1>Description</h1><br>

A few notes about the sections above:

"Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.orgusernames
"Stable tag" is not needed for themes
"Tags" is not needed since these are parsed from the style.css file
"Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
"Tested up to" is the highest version that you've successfully used to test the theme. Note that it might work on higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
Frequently Asked Questions
Is this project fully done?
No; this is the first finished draft of my website Tjejbaciller, and what I've spent my master thesis creating. Although it isn't done, that was the plan. I wanted to create something - not to be done, but something I will actually use and also will be able to keep developing as a side project.
