<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>Is this project fully done?</h4>
No; this is the first finished draft of my website Tjejbaciller, and what I've spent my master thesis creating. Although it isn't done, that was the plan. I wanted to create something - not to be done, but something I will actually use and also will be able to keep developing as a side project. <br> <br>
